## 🧠 How the AI Summarization Works

Every week, you can click **“🧠 Summarize My Week”** inside the app.  
This triggers an OpenAI GPT-4 call that:
1. Collects your last 7 days of entries & moods  
2. Sends them as a structured prompt  
3. Generates a short, compassionate reflection summary  
4. Saves it as a new entry (e.g. `summary-2025-11-11`)  
   → shown in the sidebar with a 🧠 icon
